- Xaero's World Map's creator thexaero allows us to use their mods in modpacks, with the only condition being if this modpack is distributed outside Modrinth and CurseForge we will need to give him a shoutout, so here is a link to the [original mod page](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) along with the [mod page for the minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)
- Jade's creator Snownee licensed their software under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, which means this modpack more than likely will need to use the same license down the line, will need to double-check
- Fabric API is licensed under Apache License 2.0, will need to check what needs to be done about it
- Text Placeholder API by Patbox, ScalableLux by RelativityMC, Iris Shaders by coderbot, Cloth Config API by shedaniel, and Lithium by CaffeineMC are licensed under LGPL-3.0-only, will need to check what needs to be done about it
- More Culling by fxmorin is licensed under GPL-3.0-only, will need to check what needs to be done about it
- Sodium by CaffeinMC uses PolyForm Shield License 1.0.0, which again, will be on my todo list
