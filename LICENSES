- Xaero's World Map's creator thexaero allows us to use their mods in modpacks, with the only condition being if this modpack is distributed outside Modrinth and CurseForge we will need to give him a shoutout, so here is a link to the [original mod page](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-world-map) along with the [mod page for the minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap)
- Jade's creator Snownee licensed their software under CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0, which means this modpack more than likely will need to use the same license down the line, will need to double-check
- Fabric API is licensed under Apache License 2.0, will need to check what needs to be done about it
- Text Placeholder API from Patbox, ScalableLux by RelativityMC, and Lithium from CaffeineMC are LGPL-3.0-only, will need to check what needs to be done about it
