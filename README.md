# Vanilla Nu
This is a modpack started as a project for making the server running smoother while still compatible with vanilla players, since I will be mainly using the vanilla server as a way to teach my friend how to play the game. Then my other friend keeps bugging me to add mini map since quote "most modpacks got it anyway". So here we are, he is also bugging me to add a backpack mod so, we shall see. 

# Requirement(s)
- [Concurrent Chunk Management Engine (Fabric) by RelativityMC](https://modrinth.com/mod/c2me-fabric) requires Java 22 in order to run, or at least the cersion I am using requires it. Will look into it for version 0.2

# To do
- [ ] [Xaero's Map Server Utils by xxtg666](https://modrinth.com/datapack/xaeros-map-server-utils)
  - To make the mini map toggle on server side
- Client side optimization mods

# Changelogs
## v0.1
- Mostly focusing on server only or server and client optimization mods
- AppleSkin mod for better hunger and saturation illustration
- Xaero's Map and minimap so that new players can find their way around easier
  - Adding [Xaero's Map Server Utils by xxtg666](https://modrinth.com/datapack/xaeros-map-server-utils) on next version
- Loads of data packs from Vanilla Tweak that I have to figure out how to properly integrate into the modpack
  - Idea will be to either find the original page, GitHub, or replace with something from modrinth
- Set Fabric API to version 0.121.0 because Pakku somehow keeps pulling 0.121.1 for Minecraft 1.21.6
  - Hopefully it won't come back and bite me later
- Got most of the licenses into the LICENSES file, with some still needing me to sort out
